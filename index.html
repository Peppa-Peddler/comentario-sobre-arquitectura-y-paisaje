                    I've been involved in a architecture-related project about automation on floor planning. Blueprints to appear just a few seconds after inserting some parameters.
                    This however is nothing new, It is well known that automation and optimization are words heard in everyday design and planning. What is interesting is how this both ideas only responde to economical parameters. Aesthetics in relation to landscape and design are only details in this interaction. And lately, the idea of automation to increase productivity in this regard. What we have as a result is an actual protrait of the economical interests that broad urbanization, we could see group of buildings as the literal codifications of these utilitarian models that society is based on.
                    Everyday planning is based on a very basic kind of algorithm called the bag problem, a problem solved in its basic form using a method named 'simplex'.
